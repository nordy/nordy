Hi there & Welcome! :clap::clap::clap:

I'm a <i><b>Geophysical Engineer</b></i> and currently working on the effect of the Moon's Gravity on <i><b>Earthquakes</b></i> in the Earth. ··· :fire: ··· Like everyone else, I am currently learning new things about artificial intelligence. ··· :ghost: ··· Honestly, I just can't break away from the old stuff. ··· :space_invader: ··· For example, the magical world of the <i><b>Bulletin Board System</i> (BBS)</b> cannot be forgotten. ··· :alien: ··· These may seem primitive to you, but I still believe they are exciting. ··· :thought_balloon: ··· If you have any questions, I will gladly answer them.
